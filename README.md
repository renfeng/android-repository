# android/repository

It mirrors Android SDKs, which Android Studio built-in and
standalone SDK Manager both can download from. Ideal for a crowded place,
e.g. classroom, [Study Jams](http://developerstudyjams.com/),
and [Code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Android).

Tested on 

* Linux Mint Rebecca (17.1, Ubuntu 14.04),
* Windows 7 64bit
* macOS Sierra (10.12.6)

## Prerequisites

* 68 GB storage on your disk, as of 2018-08-25 (running both `download.sh` and `download2.sh`)
* wget
  * macOS, http://brew.sh/
  * Windows, install wget with [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)
* xsltproc
  * Linux Mint/Ubuntu/Debian, ```sudo apt-get install xsltproc```
  * Windows, install libxml2 and libxslt with Cygwin, see http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html#cygwin

## Server setup

* Files will be downloaded to your working directory, which can be different than
* The directory the project is cloned into, referred as ```${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}```.
* The mirror can be hosted with an HTTP server. A sample Apache HTTPd vhost config will be printed on download complete.

For Android Studio Built-in SDK Manager
```
${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}/download2.sh
```

For Standalone SDK Manager

Install bower:

```bash
sudo apt-get install npm
npm install -g bower
```

Run the script:

```
${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}/download.sh
```

By default, it downloads from https://dl.google.com. To download from elsewhere,
set environment variable, ```DL_HOST```. e.g.

```
export DL_HOST=https://dl-ssl.google.com
```
